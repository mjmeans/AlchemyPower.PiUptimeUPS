# AlchemyPower.PiUptimeUPS
Samples for testing Alchemy Power's Pi-UptimeUPS board

These samples helped me test the board and evaluate whether it was appropriate for a project I was working on at the time. Perhaps they will be usefult to someone else too.

- PiUptimeUPS_Sample1: Uses a polling model to monitor the UPS battery low output pin GPIO 26.
- PiUptimeUPS_Sample2: Uses an event driven model to monitor the UPS battery low output pin GPIO 26.
